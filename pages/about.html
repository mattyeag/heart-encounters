          <h1>Our Story</h1>
          <p>Tyrone Elementary School experienced its first remodel when Compass Dance Academy moved into the front of the the school.  Walking down the halls of Compass, you can see adults and children alike, dancing and filling the building with laughter and joy as they experience the wonder of dance and movement. Who could have imagined Tyrone Elementary would have yet another transformation?</p>
          <br>
          <p>One morning late in May 2022, leaders from Compass along with artists, singers and teachers met to consider the unused part of Tyrone Elementary.  To our delight and surprise, the Fayette County Board of Education made the back half of Tyrone Elementary available to artisans, singers, performers and teachers.  A creative arts and equipping center called Heart Encounters was born.</p>
